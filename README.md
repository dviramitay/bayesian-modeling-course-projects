# Bayesian Modeling – Course Projects

This repository contains three Bayesian modeling projects completed as part of the university course on probabilistic models. Each notebook explores a different domain:

- **Project 1 – GP Regression on Arrival Rates**  
  Gaussian Process regression to estimate and visualize patient arrival rates across the week.

- **Project 2 – Football Team Strength Modeling**  
  Bayesian inference for attack/defense strengths and game predictions over 4 seasons.

- **Project 3 – Online Advertising Analysis**  
  Click-through rate estimation and A/B testing using Bayesian approaches.

Each project is documented and includes full implementation and discussion.
